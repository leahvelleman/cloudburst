In linguistic writing you see a lot of examples like this

       θέλει να
       θέλ-ει   να
       want-3sg that
       'wants to'
    
or sentences like this:

    All the basic forms can be combined with the future 
    particle θα /θa/ (historically a contraction of θέλει 
    να /'θelina/, 'wants to'). 
    
These show a single linguistic *form* (in this case a short phrase in Modern Greek) 
represented at several different *levels* --- written normally as `θέλει να`, 
broken into morphemes as `θέλ-ει να`, translated morpheme-by-morpheme as `want-3sg that`, 
converted into an IPA pronunciation key as `/'θelina/`, 
and so on.
