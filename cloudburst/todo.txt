TODO:
    Docstrings in touch with reality.
    Add unit tests now while the code is small. 
    TDD from now on: specify feature, then implement.
    Factor out Language class by giving each Level responsibility for its own
        sigma_star.
    Have we shot ourselves in the foot here by making Levels unpickleable?
        Figure this out now before it gets worse, and find a workaround if
        needed.
    Are there other obligatory tree operations to add?

WISHLIST:
    Make Levels callable.
    Convenience functions for realization transducers and soundchange
        transducers.
