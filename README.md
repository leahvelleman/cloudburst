Linguistic writing often includes examples like this

       θέλει να
       θέλ-ει   να
       want-3sg that
       'wants to'
    
or sentences like this:

    All the basic forms can be combined with the future 
    particle θα [θa] (historically a contraction of θέλει 
    να [θelina], 'wants to'). 
    
These show a single linguistic *form* (in this case a short phrase) represented at several different *levels* --- written normally, broken into morphemes, translated morpheme-by-morpheme into English, converted into an IPA pronunciation key, and so on.
