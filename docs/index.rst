This page hosts a few works in progress:

`Cloudburst`_ [#f1]_ is a literate programming toolkit for conlangers.

            The idea: :emphasis:`conlangs are programs` --- manmade rules that
            define a language. So tools for documenting software are also good
            tools for conlanging.  I'm trying to test this theory using
            open-source tools: Python and `HFST
            <https://github.com/hfst/hfst>`_ for specifying grammar and sound
            patterns, and Sphinx and reStructuredText for formatting.

`Nēa`_ is a personal conlang. It aims to be “realistic,” detailed, and
restrained. I'm writing it up here to eat my own dogfood and demonstrate what
Cloudburst can do.

.. [#f1] **CLOUDBURST** is the only legal Scrabble word beginning in **CL** and ending in
   **RST**. It stands for "conlang (mutter mutter mutter) reStructuredText".
