This page hosts a few works in progress.

Cloudburst is (going to be) a literate programming toolkit for conlangers.
The idea: :emphasis:`conlangs are programs` --- manmade rules that define a
language. So tools for documenting software are also good tools for conlanging. 
I'm trying to test this theory using open-source tools: Python and OpenFst for
specifying grammar and sound patterns, and Sphinx and reStructuredText for
formatting.

Nēa is (going to be) a personal conlang. It aims to be “realistic,” detailed,
and restrained. I'm writing it up here to eat my own dogfood and demonstrate
what Cloudburst can currently do.
