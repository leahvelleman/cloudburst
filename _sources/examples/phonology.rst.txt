Alphabet
########

The Nēa roman alphabet, introduced by foreign linguists and called the
*‘acéhili* by some, has fourteen letters: *‘ a c e h i l m n o p r t u.* The
first letter is a turned apostrophe, and it is indeed a letter (representing a
glottal stop) and not a punctuation mark.  Spelling is mostly phonetic, and
this small alphabet corresponds to a small inventory of vowel and consonant
sounds --- similar to that of Terrestrial languages like Hawai‘ian, though with
the addition of tone. 

There are six Nēa tones. Three are represented by vowels with an acute, macron,
or circumflex accent: *á ā â*. The other three, called *broken* tones, are
represented by these same accents combined with an underdot: *ạ́ ạ̄ ậ*. In a very
few contexts, the vowels *a u* can be seen with an underdot alone: *ạ ụ*. When
written thus, they have the effect of *breaking* the tone of a following vowel.

The letters *i* and *u* can also be marked with a dieresis: *ï ü*. This
indicates that, although unstressed, the vowel is pronounced as a separate
syllable and not as a glide or part of a diphthong. The dieresis and the
underdot do not occur on the same vowel.

The indigenous Nēa writing system is syllabic rather than alphabetic. Its
original name is simply *menậni* 'writing', but to contrast it with the roman
*‘acéhili* it can also be called the *‘apétici*, after its first four syllables
PI TI CI.

Consonants
##########

Nēa has nine consonant phonemes:

.. csv-table::
   :align: center

   p, t, k, ʔ
   m, n,  , 
        , r,, h
        , l,,

The phoneme /k/ is spelled *c*. For English-speakers, this is a reminder
of a pattern of allophony: before the front vowels /e/ and /i/,
this phoneme is pronounced [s]. 

The glides [w j], though not phonemic, are frequent in Nēa. They are allophones
of /u i/ before another vowel --- either in the same word or between words in
a phrase --- and are written *u i*. 

.. csv-table::

   `rérui`, [ré.rwi], 'make noise'
   `óio`,   [ó.jo],   ‘oil’
   `ni lāpi ạ énu ta`, [ni.láá.pjà̰é.nu.tə], 'I want you to realize'

In environments where /i/ would become [j], sequences of an alveolar
consonant followed by /i/ become palatal or palatalized consonants:
/tiV/ → [tʃV], /niV/ → [ɲV], /liV/ → [ʎV], and /riV/ → [ʝV].
And in the same environments, /ki/ --- normally pronounced [si] ---
palatalizes as well: /kiV/ → [ʃV]. These changes lead to alternations
at word boundaries depending on whether the following word begins with
a vowel or a consonant:

.. csv-table::

  `to cahụ́ti apō`, [to.kə.hṵ̀.tʃə.póó], 'on the shelf'
  `to cahụ́ti ‘ilō`, [to.kə.hṵ̀.ti.ʔi.lóó], 'under the shelf' |break|
  `ni ọ́mo`,        [ɲò̰.mo],            'I wash you/hir/it'
  `ni ‘ọ́lo`,       [ni.ʔò̰.lo],         'I say it'           |break|
  `âpe li otōca`,  [aá.pe.ʎo.tóó.ka],  'I played it'
  `âpe li rị̂ca`,   [aá.pe.li.rḭ̀í.kə],  'I found you/hir/it'

The full set of consonant *sounds* in Nēa is thus considerably larger than
the set of *phonemes*:

.. csv-table::

   p, t, tʃ, k, ʔ
    , s, ʃ,   , h

    , l, ʎ,   ,
    , r, ʝ,   ,

Vowels, stress, and tone
########################

Nēa has five phonemic vowel qualities, /a e i o u/, which can combine to form
six diphthongs, /ai ae au ao oe eo/. In stressed syllables, vowels can be long
as well as short. When unstressed, /a/ is pronounced [ə]. The diphthongs /ai au/
are pronounced [əɪ əʊ] even when stressed.

In the rare case where unstressed prevocalic /u/ does not become /w/,
or where unstressed prevocalic /i/ does not become /j/, it is written 
with a dieresis. These are analyzed phonemically as sequences of two /u/'s or
two /i/'s in a row.

.. csv-table::

   `ẹ́lüa`,  [ḛ̀.lu.ə],  'set free'
   `‘Ánïa`, [ʔá.ni.ə], men's name


Stressed syllables have tone. There are six possibilities. The first two (*sharp*)
tones are found on short vowels, the second four (*level* and *rising*) tones
on long vowels and diphthongs. Within each pair of tones, the second is *broken*, 
meaning it has some sort of glottalization: either creaky voice or interruption 
by a glottal stop.

.. csv-table::
   :widths: auto

   *á*,  (clear) sharp,  [á],  "short, high pitch"
   *ạ́*,  broken sharp,   [à̰],  "short, low pitch, creaky voice"
   *ā*, (clear) level,   [áá], "long, high pitch"
   *ạ̄*, broken level,    [áˀá], "long, high pitch, interrupted by a glottal stop"
   *â*, (clear) rising,  [aá], "long, mid-rising pitch"
   *ậ*, broken rising,   [à̰á], "long, low-rising pitch, creaky voice on first half"

A single syllable with a broken vowel is sometimes easy to confuse with a pair of
syllables separated by a glottal stop. The confusion is especially easy in the case of
a broken vowel with level tone. The most audible distinction in this case is prosodic.
A single broken level vowel has high pitch on both segments; when two vowels are
separated by a glottal stop, there can only be high pitch on (at most) one. Consider
these words, pronounced with the same segments but different melodies:

.. csv-table::
   
   `‘ạ̄i`, [ʔáˀí], ‘water’
   `‘á‘i`,[ʔá.ʔi], "‘judgment, perception'"
   `‘a‘í`,[ʔa.ʔí], ‘someday'

Except for a few interjections like `ēō` ‘whoa!’, there can only be one stressed
syllable in a prosodic word. But prosodic words do not match up one-to-one with 
dictionary entries (called *lexical words*). Some lexical words --- especially
onomatopoeia, loanwords, and compounds --- take up more than one prosodic word.

.. csv-table::

   `câ pâ`,      [kaá paá],      ‘sound of small explosions’
   `hēne pị́ti`,  [héé.ne pḭí.ti], type of horse (from Skoa *ʃeːɲ ɓit*)
   `muála ciọ́ho`,[mwá.lɐ ʃò̰.ho], ‘buck dance’

And on the other hand, some lexical words, called *clitics*, are short words that
cannot make up a prosodic word on their own.

Clitics
#######

A clitic does not form its own prosodic word, but is merged into a nearby word called
its *host*. Clitics are often unstressed, but can sometimes have stress “pushed” onto
them by their host. In the first group of examples below, the clitic `co` ‘the’ is stressless,
and in the second group it has stress pushed onto it.

.. csv-table::

   `co tạ̄na‘i`,   [ko.táˀá.nə.ʔi],  ‘the article’
   `co cệpa`,     [ko.sḛé.pə],      ‘the herbs’       |break|
   `có muru`,     [kó.mu.ru],       ‘the boy’
   `cọ́ cu`,       [kò̰.ku],          ‘the dog’

There are two kinds of clitic. *Proclitics* --- like `co` above --- come before their
hosts. In Nēa they are usually stressless but can have stress pushed onto them. *Enclitics*,
like `‘u` and `tae` in the examples below, come after their hosts. They never have stress
pushed onto them, and so are always unstressed. But they can trigger prosodic changes in
the host itself. For instance, 'dance' is `ciọ́ho` when it does not host any enclitics, but
iit becomes `ciohọ̄`, as in the second example below, when it does. They can also "pull"
stress forward off of a proclitic that it was "pushed" onto. In `cị́ tama` 'my
mat', the proclitic `ci` 'my' has stress pushed back onto it by the following
noun, but adding the enclitic `u` pulls the stress forward again.

.. csv-table::

   `náta no ciọ́ho`,  ná.tə.no.ʃò̰.ho,    'you (pl) dance'
   `to ciohọ̄ tae`, to.ʃo.hóˀó.tae,   'for you (pl) to dance'    |break|
   `cị́ tama`, sḭ̀.tə.mə, 'my mat'
   `ci tạ́ma ‘u`,  si.tə̰̀.mə.ʔu,    'our mats'
   
Enclitics in turn can be divided into two groups. The first are the *second position*
enclitics. These are attached to the first available host in a particular group of
words. The enclitics `‘u` and `tae` in the examples above are second position enclitics. 
The host they attach to is the first word of two or more syllables in the noun or
verb phrase they belong to. In EXPLAIN

The other type of enclitic are *boundary* enclitics. These come at the end of a group
of words no matter what. The remote enclitic `lo` is a boundary enclitic, and it stays
at the end of the phrase even when there is an available host earlier that the
second position enclitic `‘u` can attach to.

.. csv-table::

   `ci anête ‘u lo`,     ʃə.neé.te.ʔu.lo,       'our spears yonder'
   `âpa ‘u ni anête lo`, aá.pə.ʔu.ɲə.neé.te.lo, 'those were our spears'

   
Prosodic paradigms
##################

Nēa originally had an entirely predictable pattern of mobile stress. A word
was stressed on the third mora from the end, and if suffixes or
enclitics were added then stress would shift as a result. This stress system
eventually evolved into tone: sharp tone came from stressed short vowels,
level tone from long vowels or diphthongs stressed on their first mora, and
rising tone from long vowels or diphthongs stressed on their second mora.

.. csv-table::

   `*ʔémua`,  `‘émua`, 'table'  
   `*cáapa`,  `cāpa`, 'vase'
   `*paálaa`, `pâla`, 'ice'

There may have been an intermediate period when tone was predictable just like
the stress pattern it evolved out of. But this soon changed. Due to loanwords
and sound changes, tone quickly became unpredictable. Possibly to compensate for
this unpredictability, it also went through a large amount of regularization. 
Where formerly a word would change its prosody *each* time a suffix or enclitic
was added, in modern Nēa a word can only take a small number of prosodic shapes.

The situation now is that a Nēa word has three stems, known as *independent*, 
*dependent*, and *secondary*. For most words, the only difference between the stems
is prosodic. For a few irregular words, there are additional changes from one
stem to the next. 

The independent stem is the citation form of the word, and is used when the word
does not host any enclitics, as with `cāpa` in the first group of
examples below. The dependent stem is used when enclitics are added, as with 
`câpa` in the second group. And the secondary stem is used with certain suffixes, as
with `capạ́-` in the last group. Forms based on the secondary stem do not change further 
when enclitics are added --- as demonstrated by the very last example with the
addition of `‘u`.

.. csv-table::
   
   `co cāpa`,   'the vase'
   `no cāpa`,   'it's a vase'
   `âla ‘u ni cāpa`,  'it was our vase'       |break|
   `ci câpa ‘u`,      'our vase'
   `ni câpa ‘u`,      'it's our vase'
   `co câpa ua nie`,  'and as for the vase…'  |break|
   `co capạ́lu`,       'the big vase'
   `co capạ́ro`,       'the damn vase'
   `ni capạ́ro ‘u`,    'it's our damn vase'

Regular Nēa nouns, verbs, and adjectives belong to one of seven classes. If you
know the class of a word, you can predict how its prosody will change from one
stem to another. For instance, class one words have dependent forms with level
tone on the last syllable, and have subordinate forms with rising tone on the
last syllable. There are eight additional classes for irregular verbs --- most of
which have only a few verbs apiece. 

Morphophonological history
##########################

The behavior of these word classes is explained by the history briefly described
in the last section: they come from different stem shapes in an earlier stage
of the language in which stress was predictable and length and glottalization
were phonemic in all syllables. At that stage, the possible syllable nuclei were
the ones shown in the table below.

.. csv-table::

   *a*, *aˀ*, *aa*, *ae*, *ai*, *ao*, *au*
   *e*, *eˀ*, *ea*, *ee*, *ei*, *eo*, *eu*
   *i*, *iˀ*, *ia*, *ie*, *ii*, *io*, *iu*
   *o*, *oˀ*, *oa*, *oe*, *oi*, *oo*, *ou*
   *u*, *uˀ*, *ua*, *ue*, *ui*, *uo*, *uu*

Between that stage and modern Nēa, a few changes happened:

  1. If stress fell on a *ˀ*, it was retracted onto the preceding vowel.
  2. Glottalization moved to the stressed vowel: `*óyoˀ` → `*óˀyo` → `ọ́io` 'take'.
     This allowed long vowels and diphthongs to be glottalized: `*ʔoóloˀ` → `*ʔoóˀlo`
     → `'ộlo` 'say'.
  3. Unstressed long vowels shortened: `*tíʔaa` → `tí‘a` 'uncle'.
  4. Unstressed prevocalic `*i` `*u` became /j w/ in all but a few
     contexts: `*páˀnia` → `pạ́nia` [pə̰̀.ɲə] 'dry'. (In native vocabulary,
     the dieresis marks reflexes of the few instances of `*i` and `*u` that
     didn't go through this change: `*éˀlua` → `ẹ́lüa` 'set free',
     pronounced [ḛ̀.lu.a] not [ḛ̀.lwa].)

After these changes came a great deal of regularization. A word's prosdy had always changed
when a one-syllable enclitic was added, as in the second set of examples below. But
originally it changed *further* when additional enclitics were added, as in the third
set.

.. csv-table::
  
   `*ci cáapa`,     'my vase'
   `*cí tee`,       'my eye'      |break|
   `*ci caápa ʔu`,  'our vases'
   `*ci tée ʔu`,    'our eyes'    |break|
   `*ci caapá ʔu wa`, 'as for our vases'
   `*ci teé ʔu wa`, 'as for our eyes'

In the modern language, this is no longer the case. The dependent form of the word ---
drived from the form originally used before a one-syllable enclitic --- is now used
before two or more enclitics as well.

.. csv-table::

   `ci cāpa`,     'my vase'
   `cí te`,       'my eye'        |break|
   `ci câpa ‘u`,  'our vases'
   `ci tē ‘u`,    'our eyes'      |break|
   `ci câpa ‘u ua`, 'as for our vases', n.b. `câpa` not `*capá`
   `ci tē ‘u ua`, 'as for our eyes', n.b. `tē` not `tê`

A word's prosody had always changed when suffixes were added.

.. csv-table::

   `*méele`,      'cook'
   `*meeléciˀ`,   'be cooked'
   `*meelecíˀro`, 'be undercooked'

But because a number of common suffixes were of the form `*-CVˀ`, the specific
prosodic shift triggered by this suffix was generalized. The result was the secondary
stem, used before a large class of *secondary suffixes* --- regardless of the original
shape of those suffixes, and regardless of whether one or more was added.

.. csv-table::

   `mêle`,        'cook'
   `melẹ́ci`,      'be cooked'
   `melẹ́ciro`,    'be undercooked'

And where previously adding enclitics to a form like `*meeléciˀ` would have moved the
stress further, in the modern language words formed using secondary suffixes were
prosodically invariable.

.. csv-table::

   `*meeléciˀ`,          'be cooked'
   `*to a meelecíˀ ʔuo`, 'for it to be cooked'
   `*co a meeleciˀ ʔúo wa`, 'as for it being cooked' |break|
   `melẹ́ci`,             'be cooked'
   `to a melẹ́ci ‘uo`,    'for it to be cooked'
   `co a melẹ́ci ‘uo ua`, 'as for it being cooked'

Word classes
############

The result of all this regularization was the modern word class system. The
first six classes of regular words come from six different sets of historical
stem shapes.  In each class, the independent form is the natural outcome of the
historical antepenultimate stress rule; the dependent form is the outcome of
stress shift before a one-mora enclitic (now generalized and used before any
number of enclitics of any shape); and the secondary form is the outcome of
glottalization and stress shift before a `*-CVˀ` suffix (now generalized and
used before any number of suffixes of any shape).
